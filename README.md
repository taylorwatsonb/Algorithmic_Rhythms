# Algorithmic_Rhythms

Description: 
This p5.js animation features a dynamic wave pattern that evolves over time, creating a mesmerizing visual experience. The animation is designed to provide a calming and rhythmic aesthetic, with interactive elements that allow users to control the flow of the animation.

## Features

- Canvas Setup:The animation is displayed on a 700x700 pixel canvas with a black background, providing a stark contrast to the red sinusoidal lines.
  
- Wave Pattern: Multiple sinusoidal lines are drawn across the canvas, centered to create a symmetrical pattern. Each line moves in a smooth, flowing motion.

- Dynamic Phases: Each line has a unique, randomly initialized phase, determining its starting position in the wave cycle. The phases are continuously updated, animating the waves across the canvas.

- Animation Speed: Controlled by the `speed` variable, the animation speed influences how quickly the wave phases change, creating a dynamic flow.

- Interactivity: Users can toggle the animation on and off by clicking the mouse. This interactive feature is implemented through the `mousePressed` function, allowing the animation loop to be paused or resumed.

- **Visual Style: The waves are drawn with a red stroke color and a stroke weight of 2, standing out against the black background. The absence of fill highlights the wave outlines, enhancing the visual effect.
